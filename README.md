# Myosin-cluster-simulation
In this repo, I constructed a simple toy model to simulate the formation of myosin clusters. In my paper (in preparation), I studied how myosin cluster sizes on stress fibers are controlled in cells. In the paper, I proposed a kinetic picture of myosin cluster assembly (Fig. 1), where myosin clusters can grow via either accretion or coalescence. I want to see this simple picture deduced from experiments and image analysis can recapitulate the distribution of myosin cluster sizes in cells. 

From experiments, we propose that myosin clusters grow by myosin molecules preferentially binding to existing myosin clusters (accretion). The accretion process can depend on the underlying F-actin density. The other way myosin clusters can grow is by the coalescence of neighboring clusters. In this simple simulation, I explored how myosin cluster size distribution depends on the presence or absence of each factor. The results can further shed light on how myosin cluster sizes arise from these simple kinetic paramters.
